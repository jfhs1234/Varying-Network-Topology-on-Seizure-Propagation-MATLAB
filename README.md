# Varying-Network-Topology-on-Seizure-Propagation-MATLAB

Creates networks based on varying graph theory properties and applies wilson-cowan model to generate seizures in the varying networks to 
compare seizure propogation probability.

Runs using networktest.m

requires MATLAB brain connectivity toolbox.
